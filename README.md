# RUBIKS
C++ Graphic enabled program To teach the computer to solve a Rubiks Cube

RUBIKS.CPP is the complete code to solve a RUBIKS cube on a GUI which i creted . 
Requirements :  TurboC++ which is compatible with <graphics.h>. It can be downloaded from this link : http://turboc.codeplex.com/downloads/get/1609375

Open RUBIKS.CPP from Truboc++ . 
Find int main() 
change the path of the BGI file from "C://TC/BGI" 
To the path where BGI is stored in your compute . The easiest way to do this is to open examples in TubroC++ . Open RAINBOW.CPP ( It is an in built Developer's example. ) . Croll down to the initgraph() function and copy the pathfrom there. 

Unless you have changed too much , The  directories are usually 
"C://TC/BGI" OR "C://Turboc3/BGI"
When you Run the code, if you can see a RUBIKS cube on your screen , then the program is working just fine .Else,, you'll have to find the right directory of BGI . 

13_OCT is an optimized verion of the RUBIKS cube colving algorithm which solves the first two layers in a very qick amount of time. OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT .
